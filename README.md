# 2022 Python Collection
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created in the year 2022 while learning the basics of the language. The scripts include:

Snake Game: A classic snake game where the player guides a snake to eat food while avoiding obstacles.

Simple Password Generator: A script that generates a random password with a specified length and character set.

Calculator: A script that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Pomodoro Timer: A script that implements the Pomodoro technique, a time management method that involves working in 25-minute intervals separated by short breaks.

While Loop Break Statement: An example script that demonstrates the use of the break statement in a while loop.

All the scripts were created while learning the basics of Python, so they may not be the most efficient or optimal implementations. However, they serve as a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn Python from scratch.
