#we're creating a new range and then putting in into the list function to convert it to a list 
#c is a variable

#this word i is something we chose, these are four numbers

#   total2 = total2 + i this is a basic way but there is a shortcut
    #says the new value of total2 should be the sum of old value of total2 plus i, and that way we'll be able to add 1 2 3 4 WANING: i don't know what is not working the shortcut

print (list(range(1,8)))
#what if we wanted to find the sum of only multiples of 3 and 6 so we want to add them up and find the number 9, it could be useful when the range is much larger
#we want to be able to say if i is a multiplay of 3, so we want to check for each number and if that's true then add i to total 3 plus equals i and for that we need to learn:
#Modulo operator: when we print the remainder
print(4 % 3)
print(5 % 3)
print(1 % 3)
